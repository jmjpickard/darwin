Branch: ralph/20260111-214036
Max iterations: 20

[2026-01-11 21:40:36] ITERATION 1: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] BRANCH: Created and checked out branch: ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces because it has NO dependencies (it's a standalone new file), other tasks depend on it (code-agent.ts needs WorkspaceManager, index.ts export needs it), and it won't break the build since it's purely additive
[2026-01-11 21:41:45] EDIT: Created src/core/workspace-manager.ts with Workspace interface and WorkspaceManager class with methods: ensureWorkspacesDir, create, cleanup, cleanupAll, cleanupStale, getActive
[2026-01-11 21:42:00] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:42:05] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
