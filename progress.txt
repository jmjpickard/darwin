# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sun 11 Jan 21:40:36 GMT 2026
Branch: ralph/20260111-214036
Max iterations: 20

[2026-01-11 21:40:36] ITERATION 1: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] BRANCH: Created and checked out branch: ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces because it has NO dependencies (it's a standalone new file), other tasks depend on it (code-agent.ts needs WorkspaceManager, index.ts export needs it), and it won't break the build since it's purely additive
[2026-01-11 21:41:45] EDIT: Created src/core/workspace-manager.ts with Workspace interface and WorkspaceManager class with methods: ensureWorkspacesDir, create, cleanup, cleanupAll, cleanupStale, getActive
[2026-01-11 21:42:00] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:42:05] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
[2026-01-11 21:42:20] COMMIT: ralph: feature - Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces
[2026-01-11 21:42:30] PUSH: pushed to remote branch ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:42:30] TASK_COMPLETE: Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces
[2026-01-11 21:42:09] ITERATION 2: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:42:35] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Export WorkspaceManager from index.ts because WorkspaceManager already exists (passes: true), other tasks need this export (code-agent, darwin.ts), and it's a simple additive change with no build risk
[2026-01-11 21:42:45] EDIT: Added export for WorkspaceManager class and Workspace type from ./core/workspace-manager.js to src/index.ts
[2026-01-11 21:42:50] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:42:52] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
[2026-01-11 21:43:00] COMMIT: ralph: feature - Export WorkspaceManager from index.ts
[2026-01-11 21:43:05] PUSH: pushed to remote branch ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:43:05] TASK_COMPLETE: Export WorkspaceManager from index.ts
[2026-01-11 21:43:31] ITERATION 3: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:44:00] EVALUATE: Chose [config] - Add SSH repo fields to RepoConfig (backwards compatible) because code-agent.ts needs sshUrl field to implement SSH-based tasks, this is a prerequisite for the code-agent feature, and it's backwards compatible (adds optional fields only)
[2026-01-11 21:44:10] READ: src/core/config.ts - found RepoConfig interface at lines 11-17, normalizeRepoConfig at line 207, createTemplateConfig at line 150
[2026-01-11 21:44:30] EDIT: Added sshUrl?, defaultBranch?, description? to RepoConfig interface; updated normalizeRepoConfig to include new fields with defaultBranch defaulting to 'main'; added commented example in createTemplateConfig
[2026-01-11 21:44:35] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:44:40] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
[2026-01-11 21:44:50] COMMIT: ralph: config - Add SSH repo fields to RepoConfig (backwards compatible)
[2026-01-11 21:44:55] PUSH: pushed to remote branch ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:44:55] TASK_COMPLETE: Add SSH repo fields to RepoConfig (backwards compatible)
[2026-01-11 21:45:14] ITERATION 4: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:45:30] BRANCH: Confirmed on branch ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:45:35] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Add SSH-based task execution to code-agent with workspace lifecycle because it is the core feature that other tasks depend on (REPL task command needs code_start_ssh_task tool, darwin.ts needs workspaceManager property), has all prerequisites done (WorkspaceManager exists, RepoConfig has sshUrl fields), and is the logical next step
[2026-01-11 21:46:00] READ: src/modules/code-agent.ts - understood existing structure
[2026-01-11 21:46:20] EDIT: Added WorkspaceManager import, workspaceManager and currentWorkspace properties, getRepoPath helper, and code_start_ssh_task tool with full workspace lifecycle (clone, check ralph.sh, run, cleanup)
[2026-01-11 21:46:30] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:46:32] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
[2026-01-11 21:46:40] COMMIT: ralph: feature - Add SSH-based task execution to code-agent with workspace lifecycle
