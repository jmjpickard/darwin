Max iterations: 20

[2026-01-11 16:08:56] ITERATION 1: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 16:15:32] BRANCH: Created and checked out branch: ralph/20260111-160856
[2026-01-11 16:15:32] EVALUATE: Chose config - "Extend RepoConfig interface with SSH URL support" because it is the foundational config change that all other tasks depend on. The WorkspaceManager (feature), normalizeRepoConfig update (config), and all code-agent changes require the RepoConfig interface to have the sshUrl, defaultBranch, and description fields first. This must be done before any SSH-based functionality can be implemented.
[2026-01-11 16:16:45] EDIT: Updated RepoConfig interface in src/core/config.ts - made path optional, made name required, added sshUrl, defaultBranch, and description fields
[2026-01-11 16:16:50] BUILD_FAIL: Type errors in darwin.ts - repo.path is now optional (string | undefined) but code expects string. Errors at lines 675, 680, 702, 709, 725, 734, 738. This requires the normalizeRepoConfig task (task 2) to be done together.
[2026-01-11 16:17:00] EVALUATE: Re-evaluating - Task 1 and Task 2 must be done together since they form an atomic unit. Making path optional in RepoConfig requires updating normalizeRepoConfig to validate repos properly.
[2026-01-11 16:18:10] EDIT: Updated normalizeRepoConfig() in src/core/config.ts - added extractRepoNameFromSshUrl helper, modified validation to require path OR sshUrl, derive name from sshUrl if needed, default defaultBranch to 'main'
[2026-01-11 16:18:20] EDIT: Updated syncRepo() in src/core/darwin.ts - added early return to skip repos without local path (SSH-only repos)
[2026-01-11 16:18:25] BUILD_PASS: npm run build succeeded
[2026-01-11 16:18:30] COMMIT: Preparing to commit tasks 1 and 2
