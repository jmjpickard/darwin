# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sun 11 Jan 21:40:36 GMT 2026
Branch: ralph/20260111-214036
Max iterations: 20

[2026-01-11 21:40:36] ITERATION 1: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] BRANCH: Created and checked out branch: ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:41:15] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces because it has NO dependencies (it's a standalone new file), other tasks depend on it (code-agent.ts needs WorkspaceManager, index.ts export needs it), and it won't break the build since it's purely additive
[2026-01-11 21:41:45] EDIT: Created src/core/workspace-manager.ts with Workspace interface and WorkspaceManager class with methods: ensureWorkspacesDir, create, cleanup, cleanupAll, cleanupStale, getActive
[2026-01-11 21:42:00] BUILD: npm run build started
[2026-01-11 21:42:05] BUILD_PASS: build succeeded
[2026-01-11 21:42:20] COMMIT: ralph: feature - Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces
[2026-01-11 21:42:30] PUSH: pushed to remote branch ralph/20260111-214036
[2026-01-11 21:42:30] TASK_COMPLETE: Create WorkspaceManager class for temporary repo workspaces
[2026-01-11 21:42:09] ITERATION 2: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 21:42:35] EVALUATE: Chose [feature] - Export WorkspaceManager from index.ts because WorkspaceManager already exists (passes: true), other tasks need this export (code-agent, darwin.ts), and it's a simple additive change with no build risk
[2026-01-11 21:42:45] EDIT: Added export for WorkspaceManager class and Workspace type from ./core/workspace-manager.js to src/index.ts
[2026-01-11 21:42:50] BUILD: npm run build started
