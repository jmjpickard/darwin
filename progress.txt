[2026-01-11 13:56:16] BRANCH: Checked out branch: ralph/20260111-135548
[2026-01-11 13:56:31] EVALUATE: Chose feature - Rewrite code-agent.ts as simple ralph.sh spawner because: features before refactors/cleanup, backup already exists, and this is the core functionality change that other tasks depend on understanding
[2026-01-11 13:57:13] EDIT: Rewrote code-agent.ts as simple ralph.sh spawner - removed all terminal/PTY/beads/prd imports, simplified to just spawn ralph.sh with 4 tools: start_prd, get_status, stop_prd, list_repos
[2026-01-11 13:57:33] BUILD_PASS: npm run build succeeded

[2026-01-11 13:58:17] ITERATION 2: Starting with claude
[2026-01-11 13:58:37] EVALUATE: Chose refactor - Simplify prd-types.ts to flat structure because: refactors before cleanup, prd-types must be done before prd-manager (dependency), and this is a foundational change
[2026-01-11 13:58:52] EDIT: Simplified prd-types.ts to flat PrdItem interface with category, description, action, passes fields
[2026-01-11 14:01:23] EDIT: Simplified prd-manager.ts to flat PrdItem structure with exists, load, getItems methods
[2026-01-11 14:01:23] DELETE: Deleted terminal infrastructure files (terminal-controller, terminal-types, terminal-proxy, terminal-proxy-protocol, terminal-pty-helper, progress-manager, status-manager, terminald, test-terminal, test-enter, test-submit, prd-manager.test, progress-manager.test)
[2026-01-11 14:01:23] EDIT: Removed terminal imports from brain.ts and index.ts, removed observeTerminal and parseTerminalAction methods from brain.ts
[2026-01-11 14:01:23] BUILD_PASS: npm run build succeeded
